Description: hoodscanR is an user-friendly R package providing functions to assist 
    cellular neighborhood analysis of any spatial transcriptomics data with single-cell resolution. 
    All functions in the package are built based on the SpatialExperiment object, 
    allowing integration into various spatial transcriptomics-related packages from Bioconductor.
    The package can result in cell-level neighborhood annotation output, along with funtions to
    perform neighborhood colocalization analysis and neighborhood-based cell clustering.
